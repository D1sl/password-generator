// 1.1. Password length
// 1.2. Ask if user wants uppercase letters
// 1.3. Ask if user wants lowercase letters
// 1.4. Ask if user wants special characters

// 2. App goes through some kind of loop that concatenates a random letter from each array into a draft string and repeats it as long as the amount of requested characters are met 

// 3. App reorganizes the draft string into the final password












// Get references to the #generate element
var generateBtn = document.querySelector("#generate");

// Write password to the #password input
function writePassword() {
  var password = generatePassword();
  var passwordText = document.querySelector("#password");

  passwordText.value = password;

}

// Add event listener to generate button
generateBtn.addEventListener("click", writePassword);
